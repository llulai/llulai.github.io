# statistics overview
I'm putting together a document where I give an overview of different topics about statistics,
mainly from a _"why is it useful"_ point of view, so let's start

<dl>
    <dt>what is statistics?</dt>
    <dd>statistics is a set of tools that help us to make sense of data about events: describe
        events, analyze uncertain events, draw conclusion from events observation, predict events
        ocurrence, model interaction among events.
    </dd>
</dl>

## descriptive statistics
<dl>
    <dt>what is descriptive statistics?</dt>
    <dd>descriptive statistics is a set of tools that help us to identify <b>key central
        characteristics</b> of a <i>dataset</i>; we use these characteristics to communicate how
        the dataset is structured to other people.
    </dd>
</dl>

### variables
#### qualitative vs quantitative
#### discrete vs continuous
#### graphical representation of variables
### frequency measures
### measures of central tendency 
### measures of spread
### interaction of two variables
### central limit theorem

## probability
<dl>
    <dt>what is probability?</dt>
    <dd>probability is the mathematical study of uncertain events. just because something is
        uncertain doesn't mean we know nothing about it, so we use probabilities to describe and
        draw conclusion from uncertain events.
    </dd>
</dl>

### combinatorial problems
### random variables
### expectation, variance and moments
### probability distributions

## inferential statistics

### classification of statistical problems
### population, sample and observations
### point estimation
### interval estimation
### hypothesis testing

## statistical/machine learning
