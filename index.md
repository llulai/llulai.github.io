# llulai
in college my friends used to call me _july_ /d͡ʒʊˈlaɪ/ (in spanish, _julio_ refers
to both: the name and the month) - if you read _july_ /χuli/ in spanish, it sounds
like _hooly_, if you want a word to be read as /d͡ʒʊˈlaɪ/ you should write **llulai**

  <dd>I speak spanish, english, italian and portuguese, my next languages will
      probably be french, german and russian. you can take a look on my

  <dt>data/stats</dt>
  <dd>
      ever since my first course of stats in college I've been in love with data, how
      to describe it, manipulate it, visualize it, understand it, etc. I'm continously
      learning new methods to work with data.
  </dd>
  
  <dt>programming</dt>
  <dd>I had a couple of programming courses during college, but then kept
      learning on my own, I am pretty good with _python_ and I'm currently learning <i>go</i>.
      I'm also trying to learn more about design and analysis of algorithms.
  </dd>

  <dt>statistical/machine learning</dt>
  <dd>for the last couple of years I've been learning <i>machine learning</i>,
      I'm not currently trying to become an ml engineer (like to create novel approaches to ml),
      I'm more interested in its practical applications.

# projects

- [advent of py](https://github.com/llulai/advent_of_py): I've been programming in
[python](https://www.python.org/)
since 2008, this is a repo where I showcase my python skills by solving the
[advent of code](https://adventofcode.com).

- [advent of go](https://github.com/llulai/advent_of_go): recently I started programming in
[go](https://golang.org/), this is a repo where I solve the
[advent of code](https://adventofcode.com) using it.

- [pypyt](https://github.com/llulai/pypyt): pptx file renderer - imagine you have a
powerpoint presentation template that you need to fill it with some data, i.e. some
clients qbr, and you don't want to fill each presentation by hand, then this is 
the library you need.

- [verbs](https://github.com/llulai/verbs): I'm working on a simple program to help me
practice how to conjugate verbs in the languages I'm learning.


# what's next

- [simple ml](https://github.com/llulai/simple_ml): I'm trying to implement machine
learning algorithms in python to make sure that I fully understand how they work.

- simple stats: something similar to _simple ml_ but with statistics.
