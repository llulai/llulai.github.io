# llulai
in college my friends used to call me _july_ /d͡ʒʊˈlaɪ/ (in spanish, _julio_ refers
to both: the name and the month) - if you read _july_ /χuli/ in spanish, it sounds
like _hooly_, if you want a word to be read as /d͡ʒʊˈlaɪ/ you should write **llulai**

  <dt>data/stats</dt>
  <dd>
      ever since my first course of stats in college I've been in love with data, how
      to describe it, manipulate it, visualize it, understand it, etc. I'm continously
      learning new methods to work with data.
  </dd>
  
  <dt>programming</dt>
  <dd>I had a couple of programming courses during college, but then kept
      learning on my own, I am pretty good with <i>python</i> and I'm currently learning <i>go</i>.
      I'm also trying to learn more about design and analysis of algorithms.
  </dd>

  <dt>statistical/machine learning</dt>
  <dd>for the last couple of years I've been learning <i>machine learning</i>,
      I'm not currently trying to become an ml engineer (like to create novel approaches to ml),
      I'm more interested in its practical applications.

# what's next

- [simple ml](https://github.com/llulai/simple_ml): I'm trying to implement machine
learning algorithms in python to make sure that I fully understand how they work.

- simple stats: something similar to _simple ml_ but with statistics.
